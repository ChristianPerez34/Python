#Define a function max() that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. Use the if-then-else construct available in Python. (It is true that Python has the max() function built in, but writing it yourself is nevertheless a good exercise.)

def max(a,b):
    if (a > b):
        return a;
    else:
        return b;

print ("Finds the max of two numbers")
num1 = int(raw_input("Input first number: "))
num2 = int(raw_input("Input second number: ")) 
find_max = max(num1,num2)
print ("Max is {}".format(find_max))
